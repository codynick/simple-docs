# Welcome

This is a simple PHP documentation application powered by **Parsedown**.

It follows this structure:

- folders inside `docs/` become categories
- `.md` files become pages
- the left sidebar is generated automatically
- the search box finds matching Markdown pages

## How to add pages

Create a Markdown file anywhere inside the `docs` folder.

For example:

```text
docs/
  Getting-Started/
    Welcome.md
  Guides/
    Installation.md
  Reference/
    Configuration.md
```

The first `# Heading` in each file is used as the page title.
